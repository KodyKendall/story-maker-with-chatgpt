Chapter 3: 1626-1632: The Harper Family Divided by the Atlantic
By 1626, Thomas Harper is 27 years old, living in London, torn between the legacy of his father and the allure of the New World. Despite his deep fascination with his cousin Robertâ€™s letters and experiences, he ultimately chooses to stay in Englandâ€”a decision that pleases his father, Edward Harper.

However, fate has other plans.

1626: Thomas Stays in Londonâ€”His Fatherâ€™s Pride
Edward Harper is elated that his son has chosen the path of stabilityâ€”Londonâ€™s growing commerce, law, and the tobacco trade.
Thomas buries his wanderlust in work, helping his father manage trade contracts with merchants supplying the Virginia colony.
His younger brother, William Harper (23), is groomed to take over fully, studying under Edward and becoming a respected figure in Londonâ€™s business circles.
Despite staying, Thomas feels restless. Though he deals in colonial goods, he knows he is only profiting off the risk others take.
ðŸ“œ Letter from Thomas to Robert, 1626:
"Cousin, my hands touch the wealth of Virginia, but my feet remain in London. I wonder, have I been wise, or have I been a coward?"

Robertâ€™s reply, however, is short:

ðŸ“œ Letter from Robert to Thomas, 1626:
"It is not cowardice to stay where you belong. But be certain, cousin, that you do belong there. I belong here, and here I shall remainâ€”whether in life or in death."

1629: A Letter That Changes Everything
Three years later, in 1629, another letter arrives from Virginia. This one is not from Robertâ€”but from a fellow planter and associate, John Russell.

ðŸ“œ Letter from John Russell to Thomas Harper, London, 1629:
"Thomas,
I write to you with sorrow. Robert Wainwright is dead. Disease took him before the summer. He left no wife, no children, only his land, his debts, and his name.
By rights, his estate should go to the crown, but he spoke of you often, and before his death, he put your name in his will. If you come, the land is yours. If you do not, it will pass into another manâ€™s hands. The choice is yours. But do not wait too long.
â€” John Russell, Jamestown, Virginia"

1630: The Harper Family Divided
The news shakes Thomas to his core. Robertâ€”the bold, reckless cousin he had admired for yearsâ€”is gone.

Edward Harper is relieved. This is exactly why he never wanted his son to go. Virginia takes men, it does not reward them.
William Harper sees an opportunityâ€”the familyâ€™s business in England can expand into a more direct relationship with Virginia.
Thomas, however, is uncertain.
ðŸ“œ Letter from Thomas to John Russell, Virginia, 1630:
"What was my cousinâ€™s life worth? Did he die with nothing, or did he die with something worth claiming? Tell me truly, sirâ€”if I come, what will I find?"

Russellâ€™s reply is blunt.

ðŸ“œ Letter from John Russell to Thomas Harper, 1630:
"You will find hardship. You will find the bones of men who thought themselves stronger than they were. But you will also find land, and land is power. Your cousin did not die a rich man, but he died a free man. If you come, you may yet build something greater than he did. But if you fear the price, then do not bother."

1631: The Decision â€“ The Last Chance to Claim His Legacy
Edward Harper, now aging, urges Thomas to stay. The Virginia venture is too risky, too unstable.
William, the younger brother, takes over their fatherâ€™s business. He expands Londonâ€™s trade network and becomes a well-respected merchant and financier.
Thomas, however, can no longer ignore what he feels.
For years, he lived vicariously through letters, dreaming of adventure but never taking the risk.
Now, at 32 years old, he has one final chance to claim something of his own.

He books passage to Virginia.

1632: Arrival in the New World
In the spring of 1632, Thomas Harper steps off a ship in Jamestown, Virginia.

The colony is more stable than in Robertâ€™s time, but it is still a land of conflict, disease, and struggle.
He meets John Russell, his cousinâ€™s friend, who takes him to see the land Robert left behind.
It is wild, half-worked, strugglingâ€”but it is his.
ðŸ“œ Letter from Thomas to William, London, 1632:
"Brother,
I am here, at last. The land is rough, the people rougher. But it is mine. I shall either make something of it or I shall die trying. You are the son who remained, the one who will carry our fatherâ€™s name in London. I shall be the one who carries it here, in this place of sweat and earth. I do not know if I was right to come, but I know that I could not have stayed."

The Final Fate of the Harper Brothers
With Thomas in Virginia and William in London, the Harper family is now permanently divided between two worlds.

William Harper (London)
Becomes a successful merchant, running the family's growing trade business.
Profits from tobacco, plantation goods, and Virginia commerceâ€”ironically, from the very risks his brother has taken.
Marries into a wealthy merchant family, securing the Harper name in Londonâ€™s financial elite.
He never sees Thomas again, but they continue to write letters until the end of their days.
ðŸ“œ Letter from William to Thomas, 1633:
"I wonder, brotherâ€”are you building a home, or a prison? Will your sons live as lords in Virginia, or will they suffer the same fate as Robert? I will never know. I only know that my place is here, and yours is there."

Thomas Harper (Virginia)
Fights for survival, land, and stability in a growing colony.
Eventually marries, has children, and begins the Harper family line in America.
Struggles with native conflicts, drought, and political upheavalâ€”the reality of Virginia is far harsher than he imagined.
Dies a landowner but not a rich man, in 1650, leaving behind a family deeply tied to the land.
ðŸ“œ Final Letter from Thomas to William, 1649:
"Brother,
I think of London sometimes. Of fatherâ€™s shop, of the Thames, of the old life. But I do not regret coming here. I have built something, though not as much as I hoped. It is not the land that makes a man great, nor the wealthâ€”it is the story he leaves behind.
My story will not be written in ledgers. It will be written in the fields, in the sweat of those who come after me. I hope that is enough."

Conclusion: A Family in Two Worlds
The Harper family is now split between England and America.
William Harper ensures the familyâ€™s financial and social legacy in London.
Thomas Harper establishes the Harper name in Virginia, beginning a new generation of Americans.
The two brothers never see each other again.
Their descendants, however, will carry the Harper name through the next great trials of historyâ€”the English Civil War, the expansion of the American colonies, and beyond.
