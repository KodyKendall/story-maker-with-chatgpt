        "description": "A 17th-century London study scene where Edward reads Robert’s letter with a concerned expression, while his two sons, Thomas (15) with a determined look and William (12) appearing frightened, react in the background. The setting, complete with period decor and soft, contrasting light, underscores the pivotal shift in their perception of America.",

        "description": "A symbolic split-scene composition: one half depicts the turbulent, unforgiving landscape of Jamestown with stormy skies and rugged terrain, while the other half shows a reflective London interior with a family contemplating their future. A central, weathered letter and quill tie the two worlds together, symbolizing the critical decisions that will shape their fates.",
