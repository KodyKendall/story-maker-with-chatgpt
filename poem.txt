Whispers Across the Sea
A Poem for the Harper Family

In damp attics, brittle letters lie—
Ink-stained echoes of what once was,
Where love, ambition, and salted tears
Spanned an ocean of chance and cost.

A cousin’s plea in starving Jamestown,
A father’s caution on London’s quays,
A restless son caught between two worlds—
All bound by hope and iron wills.

Ships creaked upon the Atlantic swell,
Bearing cargo of faith and doubt,
Until war’s drum severed the tie,
And silence replaced the friendly shout.

In winter’s hush at Trenton’s gate,
Family stood on opposite lines;
A musket’s flash burned through the snow,
Parting blood as time unwinds.

Then on to dusty twilight years,
Letters folded with trembling hands—
Shadows of voices, frayed by grief,
Yearning to bridge divided lands.

Yet in the hush of paper’s breath,
A faint heart-beat of unity remains:
Two nations shaped by deeper roots
Than flags or crowns could ever claim.

O Harper name—your tears are ink,
Your story written in sweat and sun.
Both in old London’s fading glow,
And where Virginia’s rivers run.

Truth sleeps in attic chests,
Where candlelight flickers on ghostly words.
Heritage whispers across the sea,
Seeking an ear that still recalls.

For though the dawn in each new land
Rises on separate horizons,
Somewhere in those quiet letters
Lives a bond no war can truly silence.
