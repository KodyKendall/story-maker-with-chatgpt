A More Realistic Letter from Virginia (1610) – Robert’s Struggle for Survival
After considering the brutal realities of early Jamestown (1607-1610), a more accurate letter from Robert Wainwright would likely reflect the sheer misery, desperation, and hardship he faced.

The Reality of Virginia in 1610
Jamestown nearly collapsed—by 1610, only 60 of the original 500 settlers were still alive.
The "Starving Time" (1609-1610) was horrific—people ate rats, shoe leather, and even resorted to cannibalism to survive.
Money was nearly useless—there were no established markets, and most wealth came from land, food, and labor.
Robert’s survival itself is lucky—if he lived, it would have been through sheer luck, a strong body, and ruthless determination.
Indentured servants were barely better off than slaves—some tried to escape into the wilderness, but were either captured or killed by Powhatan warriors.
Letter from Robert Wainwright to Edward Harper (Spring, 1610)
(Delivered by a returning supply ship, written on stained parchment in a rough hand)

"Edward,

You were right. God help me, you were right.

Virginia is not the land of promise they spoke of. It is the land of suffering. I have nearly died three times—once from fever, once from hunger, once from arrows. I live, but I do not know if I will continue to.

I have seen things, cousin, things I cannot even write. Men eating the flesh of the dead, grown men weeping for want of bread, good Englishmen turned to thieves, willing to murder for a handful of meal.

But listen well, for I do not regret my choice. I have chosen hardship over a debtor’s prison, and I will see this through. If I live, I will claim land here, and I will make something of myself. But I cannot do it alone.

Edward, I need you to send me tools, supplies, and provisions. Forget coin—money is worthless in a place with no bread to buy. I need steel for plows, cloth for shelter, dried food to keep me through the winter. If you can spare anything, send it with the next ship. If I do not live to receive it, know that I died a free man.

If you tell your sons anything of me, tell them this: if they wish to come to Virginia, they must be made of iron. Hope alone will not carry them through.

Robert Wainwright
Jamestown Colony, Virginia"

Analysis: Would Money Even Help?
Coinage was almost useless in early Jamestown. There were no functioning markets, only barter and survival trading.

What had real value was:

Food (corn, dried meats, grain)
Tools (hammers, saws, axes, plows)
Weapons (muskets, powder, swords)
Clothing & fabric (sails, canvas, wool for warmth)
Medicine & liquor
Even by 1610, Jamestown was not profitable. It wouldn’t be until tobacco cultivation took off in the 1620s that wealth became possible.

✅ So yes, money from England was almost worthless. Sending tangible supplies would be the only thing that could actually help Robert.

Edward’s Reaction – A Turning Point for His Sons?
Edward reads the letter in his London home, staring at the words his cousin has written.
His cautious nature is confirmed—he was right to stay in England.
But his sons?
Thomas (now 15) reads the letter and feels sobered but not dissuaded. He still dreams of the New World but realizes it will take more than just boldness—it will take strength, cunning, and survival skills.
William (12) grows fearful. The world beyond England seems terrifying now.
For the first time, the idea of America shifts in the Harper household. No longer just a land of dreams—but a land of trials and suffering.

Edward faces a choice: Does he risk sending valuable supplies to a cousin who may not even survive long enough to receive them?

Would you like to continue the story—perhaps exploring:

Edward’s decision—does he send the supplies, or is it a lost cause?
Robert’s fate—what happens in Jamestown over the next few years?
Thomas—will he grow into a man who still longs for America, or will the letter change him?






You said:
Edward's sends supplies, Robert sticks more to his father's business, and Thomas continues to send letters back and forth with Robert. The family lives vicariously through the letters and dramas sent by Thomas. (Is this a realistic scenario?) Play it forward
